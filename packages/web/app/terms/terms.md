## 1. OUR SERVICES

The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

### Plans, billing, and refunds

Some features of the Services require a paid plan, usage-based charges, credits, or other fees. Current plan details and pricing are described on our pricing page or checkout flow and are incorporated into these Legal Terms by reference.

If you purchase a paid plan, you authorize us and our payment processors to charge the applicable fees, taxes, and any usage-based amounts according to the plan terms you selected. Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions renew automatically for successive billing periods until canceled.

You may cancel your paid plan at any time. Unless required by applicable law, fees already paid are non-refundable and cancellations take effect at the end of the current paid billing period. We may change pricing, plan features, usage limits, or credit policies from time to time. Any such changes will apply prospectively after notice through the Services or by email.

### Usage limits and rate limiting

Your use of the Services may be subject to usage quotas, rate limits, fair-use restrictions, request-size limits, concurrency limits, or similar controls. These limits may vary by plan and may be updated from time to time.

We may throttle, delay, reject, or suspend requests that exceed applicable limits or that we reasonably determine are abusive, harmful, or likely to impair service stability, security, or availability.

### Accounts and access

Certain features require an account. You agree to provide accurate account information and to keep it up to date.

If you choose to sign in through a third-party authentication provider (such as GitHub), you authorize us to receive account information from that provider as permitted by your authorization settings and the provider's policies. Your use of such provider is also subject to that provider's terms and policies.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and access tokens, and for all activities that occur under your account. If you suspect unauthorized use of your account, you must promptly notify us.

You may delete your account using available account settings. Account deletion may result in loss of access to associated data and features, subject to legal retention requirements and our data handling policies.

## 2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

### Our intellectual property

We are the owner or the licensee of all intellectual property rights in our Services, including all source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics in the Services (collectively, the "Content"), as well as the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the "Marks").

Our Content and Marks are protected by copyright and trademark laws (and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws) and treaties around the world.

The Content and Marks are provided in or through the Services "AS IS" for your personal use, internal business use, or other uses expressly permitted under your plan and these Legal Terms.

Subject to your compliance with these Legal Terms, including the "PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES" section below, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:

- access the Services; and

- download or print a copy of any portion of the Content to which you have properly gained access,
solely for your personal use, internal business use, or other uses expressly permitted under your plan and these Legal Terms.

Except as set out in this section or elsewhere in our Legal Terms, no part of the Services and no Content or Marks may be copied, reproduced,
aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded,
translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited
for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without our express prior written
permission.

If you wish to make any use of the Services, Content, or Marks other than as set out in this section or elsewhere in our Legal Terms, please address your request to: [support@ultrahope.dev](mailto:support@ultrahope.dev). If we ever grant you the permission to post, reproduce, or publicly display any part of our Services or Content, you must identify us as the owners or licensors of the Services, Content, or Marks and ensure that any copyright or proprietary notice appears or is visible on posting, reproducing, or displaying our Content.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in and to the Services, Content, and Marks.

Any breach of these Intellectual Property Rights will constitute a material breach of our Legal Terms and your right to use our Services will terminate immediately.

### Your submissions

This section distinguishes between (a) feedback you provide about the Services and (b) code and related materials you submit for processing through the Services.

Feedback: If you send us questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, bug reports, or other feedback about the Services ("Feedback"), you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, and incorporate that Feedback into our products and services without compensation to you.

Input Content and Output: Source code, diffs, prompts, repository metadata, and other materials you submit to the Services for processing ("Input Content") are not Feedback unless you clearly submit them as Feedback. You retain all right, title, and interest in and to your Input Content. We do not acquire ownership of your Input Content.

Limited license to operate the Services: You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, copy, transmit, process, and display your Input Content only as necessary to provide, maintain, secure, and improve the Services for you, comply with law, and prevent abuse.

## 5. USER GENERATED CONTRIBUTIONS

The Services allow you to submit content to us in order to use the product features (for example, repository metadata, code diffs, prompts, commands, and feedback) (collectively, "Contributions"). The Services are not a public publishing platform, and your Contributions are submitted primarily for processing and service operation rather than public display.

## 6. CONTRIBUTIONS, DATA USE, AND AI OUTPUT

You and Services agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information and personal data that you provide and your choices (including settings).

By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding the Services, you agree that we can use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.

We do not assert any ownership over your Contributions. You retain full ownership of all of your Contributions and any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with your Contributions. We are not liable for any statements or representations in your Contributions provided by you in any area on the Services. You are solely responsible for your Contributions to the Services and you expressly agree to exonerate us from any and all responsibility and to refrain from any legal action against us regarding your Contributions.

### AI SERVICES AND GENERATED OUTPUT

The Services use artificial intelligence and large language models ("AI Services") to generate content such as commit messages, pull request titles, and pull request descriptions ("Output").

Output may be incomplete, inaccurate, offensive, or unsuitable for your use case. You are solely responsible for reviewing, validating, and approving Output before use in your repositories, workflows, or production systems.

AI Services are probabilistic and may produce different Output for similar or identical inputs. We do not guarantee that Output will be correct, complete, consistent, or fit for any particular purpose.

To provide the Services, we may process your Contributions and related request data through third-party providers, including via Vercel AI Gateway. We may change models, providers, and routing configurations at any time, including for performance, reliability, safety, availability, or cost reasons.

Tool role in your workflow: The Services function as a developer tool in your workflow, similar to a Unix pipeline component. The Services process your input and return assistive output, but you remain solely responsible for deciding whether and how to use that output.

## 7. SERVICES MANAGEMENT

## 8. TERM AND TERMINATION

These Legal Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services.
