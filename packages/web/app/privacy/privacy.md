In Short: Yes. We provide AI-powered developer text generation features.

Our AI features generate commit messages, PR titles, and PR descriptions.

We route AI requests through third-party AI providers using Vercel AI Gateway. See current models/providers at [https://ultrahope.dev/models](https://ultrahope.dev/models).

- We send submitted content (for example code diffs and command inputs) to AI providers for generation.
- We store submitted input and generated output in your account for history and reprocessing.

You must use AI features in compliance with provider terms and policies.

## 7. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?

In Short: If you use GitHub login, we receive profile information from GitHub.

If you choose GitHub OAuth login, we receive profile data such as your name, email, and profile image. We use this information only to provide authentication and account features in the Services.

GitHub also processes your data under GitHub's own policies. Review their notice at [https://docs.github.com/privacy](https://docs.github.com/privacy).

## 8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?

In Short: Yes. We process data in the United States and other countries where our providers operate.

Our infrastructure is primarily in the United States. Your information can be transferred to and processed in countries where our providers operate (for example the United States and France).

For EEA/UK/Switzerland users, we apply appropriate safeguards, including contractual protections such as Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable.

## 9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We keep data while your account is active, then delete from active systems on account deletion (subject to legal exceptions).

We retain the following while your account is active:

- Account information
- Service usage data
- Session data and authentication tokens
- Billing and payment records

We do not run automatic age-based or inactivity-based deletion for active accounts.

When you delete your account (Section 18):

- We delete account data from active databases
- We do not currently operate backup archives for user data
- If backup operations are introduced in the future, we will publish the retention period in this notice
- We may retain billing records longer where required by tax/accounting law

## 10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

In Short: We use technical and organizational controls to protect personal information.

Our controls include:

- Better-Auth based account/session management
- Authenticated session and bearer-token based API protection
- Device authorization flow for CLI sign-in
- Free-tier daily request quota controls to reduce abuse
- Single-use password reset token flow via email
- Managed hosting and data infrastructure (Vercel and Turso)
- Secret handling through environment variables (no client-side hardcoded secrets)

No system is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized parties will never defeat safeguards. Use the Services in a secure environment.

## 11. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

In Short: No. We do not knowingly collect data from minors under 18 (or the equivalent local age).

If we learn that we collected personal information from minors in violation of this policy, we will deactivate the account and delete relevant data. Contact [support@ultrahope.dev](mailto:support@ultrahope.dev) if you believe this occurred.

## 12. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

### Account Information

You can request account termination at any time. On valid request, we deactivate or delete account data from active systems, subject to legal retention exceptions.

If you disable cookies, you will not be able to stay signed in to the Services.

## 13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most browsers support Do-Not-Track (DNT) settings. Because there is no uniform DNT standard, we do not currently respond to DNT signals.

If a binding DNT standard is adopted in the future and applies to us, we will update this notice.

In Short: Yes. Residents of certain U.S. states have specific statutory privacy rights.
