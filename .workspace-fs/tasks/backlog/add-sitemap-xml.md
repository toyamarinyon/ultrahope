# Add sitemap.xml for discoverability

Owner: satoshi

Context:
- https://ultrahope.dev/sitemap.xml currently returns 404.
- Crawlers do not get a structured index of important pages.

Acceptance criteria:
- `/sitemap.xml` exists and returns XML successfully.
- Include all canonical public pages (top, pricing, login, terms, privacy, forgot-password).
- `lastmod` and `priority` are set where reasonable.
- URL list is generated by build step or static file in a maintainable process.

Next action:
- Add `/sitemap.xml` generation/route and validate it is updated when new public pages are added.
