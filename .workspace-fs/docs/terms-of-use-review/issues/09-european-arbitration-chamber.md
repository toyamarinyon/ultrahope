# Issue #9: European Arbitration Chamber unusual for Japan-based company

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ⬜ TODO

## Problem

**Terms state (Section 11):**
> "Any dispute...shall be referred to and finally resolved by the International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146)..."

**Reality:** The company is based in Kyoto, Japan. The governing law is Japanese law. Using a Belgian arbitration institution is unusual and potentially costly for both parties. The arbitration seat is Kyoto, but the administering institution is in Brussels — this creates procedural complexity.

## Recommended Action

Consider using a Japan-based or Asia-Pacific arbitration institution (e.g., Japan Commercial Arbitration Association — JCAA, or the ICC International Court of Arbitration with a Tokyo seat). Alternatively, if the European Arbitration Chamber was chosen intentionally, document the reasoning.
