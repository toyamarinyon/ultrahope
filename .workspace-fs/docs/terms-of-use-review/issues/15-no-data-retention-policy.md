# Issue #15: No data retention policy disclosed

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ✅ DONE

## Problem

**Terms state:** Nothing about how long user data (Input Content, Output, command execution history, generation metadata) is retained.

**Reality:** Based on the codebase analysis:
- `commandExecution` table stores full request payloads (diffs, args, metadata)
- `generation` table stores complete AI outputs, costs, model info
- `generationScore` table stores user feedback
- No automated cleanup mechanisms exist
- Data is retained indefinitely unless user deletes their account

**Privacy Policy states (Section 9):**
> "We retain data for as long as you maintain an account, with no automated cleanup based on age or inactivity."

**Issue:** The Terms of Use should reference or incorporate the data retention policy, especially since:
1. Users submit proprietary code/diffs
2. Data includes detailed usage/cost tracking
3. No time-based expiration exists

## Recommended Action

Add a brief data retention clause to Section 1 (OUR SERVICES) or Section 16 (USER DATA), such as:

> "We retain data you submit to the Services and data generated by your use of the Services for as long as you maintain an account, unless you request deletion. For details on data handling, retention, and your rights, see our Privacy Policy at https://ultrahope.dev/privacy."

This provides transparency and directs users to the full policy.

## Resolution

**Completed:** 2026-02-11

Added retention transparency language to Section 16 and linked the Privacy Policy for details.

**Summary of changes:**
- Added statement that account and usage data may be retained as needed for service delivery, legal compliance, dispute resolution, and enforcement.
- Added direct reference to the Privacy Policy URL for retention details and data handling practices.

**Files changed:**
- `packages/web/app/terms/terms.md:272`
